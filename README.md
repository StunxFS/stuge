# Stuge

Stuge (**Stu**nxFS's **G**ame **E**ngine) is a 2D top-down game
engine (for GTA-style games) developed in C, using
[raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) as a base.

The goal of the project is to have a base on which to develop a
2D top-down game easily.

Stuge is arranged in a way that makes it easy to know what you
want to modify:

* `assets/`: The assets used by the project are housed in this
    folder, such as language files, maps, scripts, graphics, sprites,
    etc. These are embedded in the binary.

* `src/`: The engine code, the heart of Stuge.

* `tools/`: Useful scripts that can be used to make development easier.
